Sometimes I tinker with some CSS.

Most times I just note down something interesting, because I'm
likely to forget it after a while.

Right now, this is me tinkering with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),
using a theme based on [Not Pure Poole](https://github.com/vszhub/not-pure-poole),
except I ripped-out the pure.css framework from it
(because I don't want a framework cluttering up the CSS and the HTML).

p.s. Here's my [resume](/resume/index.html).
