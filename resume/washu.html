            creating a <strong>pattern library</strong> (using <strong>fractal.build</strong> with <strong>Twigjs, SCSS, and Javascript</strong>)
            to prototype the designer's comps for review and easy revisions.
            Then implemented the site using <strong>CraftCMS</strong>, using the pattern library to generate
            the files for the templates, styles, and scripts for the CMS.
            That resulted in a living design system that directly supported the site.
            Worked on performance and accessibility improvements after the initial rollout,
            and did code reviews and mentoring for the developer who took over regular maintenance of the site.
