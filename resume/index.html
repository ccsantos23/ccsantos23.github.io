      <h3>Momentus Technologies (Ungerboeck)</h3>
      <div class="duration">09/2018 &ndash; 09/2023</div>
      <div class="details">
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Implemented the rewrite of the company's website,
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="view it on the Internet Archive" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200627130101/https://ungerboeck.com/">ungerboeck.com</a>,
            in 2018-19 (Ungerboeck rebranded as Momentus Technologies in 2023),
            creating a <strong>pattern library</strong> using <strong>fractal.build</strong> with <strong>Twigjs, SASS, and JavaScript</strong>
            to prototype the designer's comps for review and easy revisions.
            Then implemented the site with <strong>CraftCMS</strong> (learned during the project), setting up the development environments
            so that the pattern library generated the files for the templates, styles, and scripts for the CMS.
            That resulted in a living design system that directly supported the site,
            allowing us to quickly prototype, review, and deploy new sections and design tweaks that came later.
            <br/>Also worked on performance and accessibility improvements after the initial rollout,
            and did code reviews and mentoring for the developer who took over regular maintenance of the site.
          </li>
          <li>
            Worked with a team on enhancements and bug fixes for the company's back-office software's user interface,
            which used <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>VB.Net</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, <strong>Aurelia</strong>, and <strong>SASS</strong>,
            and involved much troubleshooting of legacy code in the back-end.
            Improved accessibility and semantic correctness of legacy HTML markup.
            Communicated changes made through detailed pull requests in GitHub.
            Our team used agile processes with Atlassian tools like Jira and Confluence.

            those provided by a 3rd Party.</li>
          <li>Early adoption of responsive web design after reading Ethan Marcotte's book,
