The [backdrop-filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/backdrop-filter) property
lets you apply graphical effects to the area behind an element.

I've probably come across this before, but forgot all about it until a recent episode of the
[syntax podcast](https://syntax.fm/show/672/reacting-to-state-of-css-survey).
They were talking about the `drop-shadow` filter, but I searched for `backdrop-filter`
instead when I misremembered what they said.  The `backdrop-filter` is pretty cool,
saving you from having to setup a pseudo-element positioned behind the element
to get a filter going.
