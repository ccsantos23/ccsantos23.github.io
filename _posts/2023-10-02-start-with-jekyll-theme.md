title: Start with a Jekyll Theme Instead

After creating this blog with the default `minima` theme, I found an
article about a simpler way to start a Jekyll blog:
[Using Jekyll Themes and hosting on Github.io](https://gaopinghuang0.github.io/2017/10/22/jekyll-theme-and-github-pages).
Essentially: start with a good theme.

I looked around in [jekyllthemes](http://jekyllthemes.org/), and found one
that I liked: [Not Pure Poole](https://github.com/vszhub/not-pure-poole).
Checked the [license](https://github.com/vszhub/not-pure-poole/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
on it to verify that I could download and modify the code, and went ahead and did
that. (I could have forked the repo, but I already had a repo created for this site.)
It's easier to customize with the actual code files themselves, instead of
including it as a theme (with `gem`) and then adding overrides.

Already did some tweaks.  Will be doing some more.
