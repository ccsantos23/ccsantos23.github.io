CSS Nesting support finally landed on Firefox last month.

Heard about it on this episode of syntax.fm:
[CSS Nesting is Here! â€” Syntax Podcast 665](https://syntax.fm/show/665/css-nesting-is-here).
{% include preview.html url="https://syntax.fm/show/665/css-nesting-is-here" %}

See the reference on MDN:
[Using CSS nesting - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting/Using_CSS_nesting).

I can mostly skip using SASS now (I did the styles for the [resume](https://ccsantos23.github.io/resume/index.html)
page with just plain CSS).  The Jekyll theme that I copied for this site
uses SASS though (well, I guess that would be most any Jekyll site, since
it has SASS support built-in).  Someday I might de-SASSify it.
